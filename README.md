# AuroraRetailManager

A retail management system

## Initial Plan

Build a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) the we can expand to cover all of the features we need over time.

We will start this project with **.NET Framework**, with the goal to update it to the newer .NET versions (.Net Core 3.1, .NET 5 or 6) so we can go through the upgrade pains (or not).

* SQL database (SSDT - [SQL Server Data Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssdt/download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt?view=sql-server-ver15))
* WebAPI with authentication
